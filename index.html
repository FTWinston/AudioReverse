    <h1>The Audio Reversing Game</h1>
    <h2>By <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com">Chris Tralie</a> for <a href = "../../../">CS 472: Digital Music Processing</a></h2>
    <p>The purpose of this exercise is to show students the waveform representation of audio, and to add a fun exercise on top of it.  When you record audio, it will show up as a plotted waveform below.  You can then play it back in reverse.  A fun challenge is to then open this in a new tab and try to match the sounds of the reversed speech, and see if the reverse of that sounds like the original.</p>
    <p>
      For context: I used to play this game for fun all the time with my friend <a href = "https://premiumbs.bandcamp.com/">Brendan Sellers</a> when we were messing around in his recording studio.
